Example- How to rename a branch:
	
	Summary of Steps:
	Rename the local branch:
	git branch -m master main
	Push the main branch to GitHub:
	git push origin main
	Set main as the default branch on GitHub.
	Delete the old master branch on GitHub:
	git push origin --delete master
	Update your local branch references:
	git fetch origin
	git branch -u origin/main main
	
	***After this, your repository will use main as the default branch both locally and remotely.

## Detailed Examples for DevOps

### 1. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows you to automate workflows for your repositories. Hereâ€™s an example of a basic CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and deploys your code whenever a commit is made to the `main` branch.

#### Example: Basic CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest

    - name: Deploy
      if: success()
      run: |
        echo "Deploying application to production..."
        # Deploy commands go here


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Building project..."'
                // Add your build commands here, e.g., npm run build or mvn install
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Running tests..."'
                // Add your test commands here, e.g., pytest or npm test
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Deploying..."'
                // Add your deployment commands here, e.g., kubectl apply or scp commands
            }
        }
    }
}
